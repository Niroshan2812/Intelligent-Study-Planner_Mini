# In Tribuo

Let consider this seanrio 

## The exam score predictor 

"If i study for  hours, what marks will i get ?"

lets define historical data from past exams

1. Studied 1 hr --> got 20 marks
2. Studied 2 hr --> got 40 marks
3. studied 4 hr --> got 80 marks 

so the goal is 

"Train AI to find the pattern so it can predict the score for 3 hr "
